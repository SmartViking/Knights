  <h1>Game Rules:</h1>

  <section id="rules">
    <p>The aim of the game is to visit all the <em class="beige">beige</em> squares with the Knight. The knight starts in the upper left and can only do knight movements, as in chess. When a field has been visited, it becomes <em class="green">green</em>. <br /><br />
      <em class="blue">Blue</em> fields cannot be visited, they are obstacles.</p>
    
    <p>For every square you visit you get points. You also get bonus points at the end of the level, the faster you finish a level the more bonus points you get.</p>
