Knights
=======

A puzzle game where you must fill a board using only knight movements. It's pretty much a clone of the game troyis.

Run the game with the file `run.py`.

I've tested it on Python 2.6 and 2.7.

It requires pygame and pyyaml. The debian package names for those libraries are python-pygame and python-yaml, respectively.

The settings.yaml file is full of settings you can tinker with, if you want, you can change the game drastically through that file.
