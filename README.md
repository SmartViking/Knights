Knights
=======

A puzzle game where you must fill a board using only knight movements. It's pretty much a clone of the game troyis. If you want, you can watch this [gameplay video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_faK8K-Pzk) which shows how you can download and play.

Run the game with the file `run_game.py`.

Tested on Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2 on Ubuntu. So the game should be Python 3 compitable.
Also tested on Windows 7 with Python 2.7, no problems except that the font wasn't available. This doesn't really matter because the game worked fine, but I might include fonts with the game in the future.

The game requires pygame. The debian package name is python-pygame.

The settings.yaml file is full of settings you can tinker with, if you want, you can change the game drastically through that file.

The file help/help.html contains the rules of the game. The file help/development.html contains some documentation about how the game works.
